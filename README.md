CRA Risk Experiment 1
=====================
This repository contains the code used to run a risk experiment run in Fall 2017. The experiment runs on 11 interconnected nodes, with 4 nodes acting as routers which are affected by different pieces of pseudo-malware. This code is highly experimental, both in the sense that it runs an experiment and that the code is fairly untested.
